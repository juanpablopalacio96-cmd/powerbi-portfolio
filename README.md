# Power BI Portfolio

This repository showcases Power BI dashboards focused on warehouse operations, logistics performance, and inventory management.

The projects presented here are based on real operational use cases, with data anonymized, and are designed to support daily decision-making, performance monitoring, and operational control in warehouse and industrial environments.

## Projects

### Warehouse Picking Productivity Dashboard
Dashboard designed to monitor picking productivity and operational performance in warehouse operations.  
It provides visibility into productivity trends, daily output, and performance deviations to support workforce planning and efficiency improvements.

### Forklift Utilization Productivity Dashboard
Operational dashboard developed to analyze forklift utilization and driver productivity.  
It supports equipment efficiency analysis, workload balancing across shifts, and identification of idle time or underutilized resources.

---

### Inventory Tracking – Physical vs System Stock
Inventory monitoring dashboard designed to track daily differences between physical stock counts and system (theoretical) inventory.  
It supports cyclic inventory control, discrepancy detection, and inventory accuracy improvement by product and time period.
